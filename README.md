There have been a lot of covid vaccine centers popping up, so I have created a Yelp style website
for covid vaccine centers to inform users about local vaccine centers around them. Created with 
Mongodb, Express, and Node.

## Please have the following installed locally:
* Node.js
* Mongodb 

## Dependencies
* ejs
* ejs-mate
* express
* mongoose
* nodemon
* connect-flash
* express-session
* joi
* method-override

## Usage (3 Terminals Needed)
1. Run 'npm install' in the root directory to install all dependencies
2. Start your Mongodb server (in one terminal run 'mongod', then in the other run 'mongo')
3. Run 'node seed/index.js' to seed the database
4. Run 'nodemon index.js' in another terminal
5. Visit http://localhost/3000 to access the site
6. Enjoy!
